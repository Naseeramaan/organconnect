## Abstract

Organ transplantation has long been hindered by inefficiencies, lack of transparency, and ethical concerns, leading to organ shortages and the rise of organ trafficking. As of 2023, more than 100,000 individuals globally remain on waiting lists for organ transplants, many of whom tragically die due to delayed or failed donations. Current organ donation systems are predominantly centralized, making them prone to data breaches, manipulation, and administrative delays. Existing methods also suffer from inadequate donor-recipient matching algorithms and lack of real-time monitoring, exacerbating the global shortage of transplant organs.

OrganConnect addresses these issues by implementing a blockchain-based platform to secure, automate, and streamline the organ donation process. Blockchain implementation uses cryptographic hash blocks to ensure transparency, immutability, and data security. A robust donor-recipient matching algorithm increases operational efficiency. The platform uses a role-based user system—comprising donors, recipients, hospitals, and administrators—to enable a smoother and more reliable organ donation and transplantation process. The system is designed to mitigate challenges like mismatched donations, delays, and data vulnerabilities, fostering a more ethical, transparent, and efficient ecosystem for organ donation and transplantation.

**Keywords:** Blockchain Technology, Organ Donation, Transplantation, Cryptographic Hashing, Data Security

## Features

- **Blockchain Security:** All data is stored in cryptographically hashed blocks to ensure immutability and prevent tampering.
- **Role-Based Access:** Supports distinct roles for donors, hospitals, and administrators, each with custom permissions.
- **Prevention of Organ Trafficking:** Blockchain transparency and traceability help prevent manipulation and illegal activities.
- **Efficient Matching Algorithm:** Robust donor-recipient matching increases operational efficiency and reduces delays.(Under Production)
- **Hospital-Only Access:** Only authorized hospitals and hospital-specific donors can access the system.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with modern web technologies for ease of use by hospital staff.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Monitors all actions and transactions on the blockchain for audit and compliance.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, Django
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
